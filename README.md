How to f*ck up Instagram properly...

#IRANIAN DEVELOPERS

I will add the project next few days.
You can Register via Email or Phone Number. All API is new and extracted from v180 of Instagram's Android.

This feature is available as a built-in feature in private version of InstagramApiSharp, check [here](https://github.com/ramtinak/InstagramApiSharp/issues/243) for more information.

I won't answer to any question! 

This project uses latest version of [InstagramApiSharp](https://github.com/ramtinak/InstagramApiSharp) as it's base. 

I'm going to update public repository of [InstagramApiSharp](https://github.com/ramtinak/InstagramApiSharp) one more time to get this job done.

A Nowruz [new year of Iranian and Persian languages] gift to all around the world.
