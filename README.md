How to f*ck up Instagram properly...

## IRANIAN DEVELOPERS

I will add the project within the next few days.
You can Register accounts via `Email` or `Phone Number`. All `API` is new and extracted from v180 of Instagram's Android.

This feature is available as a built-in feature in private version of InstagramApiSharp, check [here](https://github.com/ramtinak/InstagramApiSharp/issues/243) for more information.

#### I won't answer to any question! So don't ask.

This project uses latest version of [InstagramApiSharp](https://github.com/ramtinak/InstagramApiSharp) as it's base. 

I'm going to update public repository of [InstagramApiSharp](https://github.com/ramtinak/InstagramApiSharp) one more time to get this job done.
